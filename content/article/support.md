Here we outline what kind of ongoing support users can expect by owning an XPS 730x system.

## Dell

Dell ended internal support for drivers, firmware and packages in late 2009.  Technical support
was available under annual costs up until 2014.

## Wikipedia

A page on Wikipedia, Dell XPS 730x, has been created dedicated to the XPS 730X.  You may find similar content 
here and on that page.
