			<p>This is a wiki dedicated to the Dell XPS 730x systems.  Here you will find non-documented manuals and procecures, software and drivers, instructions on how to modify your system and a lot more.</p>

			<h2>730x.org - History, Future and Longevity</h2>

			The wiki is setup to be hosted and stable until 2027.

			<h3>History</h3>

			<p>I, <a href="http://eduncan911.com">Eric Duncan</a>, have an unhealthy obsession with the XPS 730x systems.  I never before bought a "brand" desktop system from a manufacturer, such as Dell, Gateway or alike.  Instead, I have been building systems since I was 12 years old (that's the 80s, btw).  One of my first purchases for a desktop was when I upgraded my 8086 from 512kB of ram to 640kB at age 14 - I could multi-task more!</p>

			<p>In 2006, while working with Microsoft partners I had a contract to develop a new-type of blog for Dell called the Dell One2One.  It was awesome - direct access to Dell engineers blogging about their latest breakthroughs and development.  How to overclock and upgrade your systems, what was in the pipeline, prototype behemoths, etc.</p>

			<p>It was at this Dell weblog that I was introduced to the XPS 700 series: a "user-upgradeable" system for the high-end consumers.  This fascinated me knowing that while all other Dell systems were all proprietary components, this XPS 700 series used real ATX-compatible components.  It was even advertised as "User-Upgradeable."  When the "prototype" of the XPS 730 with full ATX components was announced I started to say, "If I ever bought a complete desktop system, it would be the XPS 730 series."</p>

			<p>In the spring of 2009, that dream came true.  While the astronomical price of the new high-end H<sub>2</sub>C options was out of my range, I found the "low end" versions of the XPS 730X (Core i7) in the Dell Outlet (refurbs).  The idea that I apply to building my own systems was applied here: buy good chassis and motherboard, buy cheap components and upgrade the components as the prices drop.</p>

			<p>Fast forward six months to late 2009 and all of the sudden, all XPS 730X links disappeared from Dell's website.  Drivers seemed to have broken links on their support site.  Most suspicious of all was an order a friend of mine did for a custom build of a new Dell XPS 730X H<sub>2</sub>C was "canceled": in exchange, he was offered the high-end Alienware Area-51 ALX.  "We would like to offer in exchange the Alienware Area-51 ALX.  It has the same CPU, memory, overclocking compabilities and the same graphics.  We will discount the system to the same price you paid for the XPS system."  That "discount" we found was a $1,150 discount over the same configuration for both machines.  In short, after he received it, I immediately opened the Alienware Area-51 ALX up and to my surprise found the exact same motherboard and components as my XPS 730X!</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p><cite>I immediately opened the Alienware Area-51 ALX up and to my surprise found the exact same motherboard and components as my XPS 730X!</cite></p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>It was at this time I decided to hoard all materials, drivers and software I could find on the system.  In November 2009, my suspicions was certified with an announcement by Dell that they have discontinued the XPS 700 series indefinitely.  The facts are there above: the same high-end components were in both the Dell XPS 730X and the Alienware Area-51 with the Alienware being more profitable.  Rumors were blogged that Dell, who owns Alienware, decided that the XPS 730X was competing for gaming sales and cutting into margins (profits).  Therefore, it was canceled.</p>

			<p>Dell, while officially continuing to support their warranty, dropped all internal support for the XPS 730X; broken links stayed broken, customers with problems were offered Alienware machines as replacements instead of parts being sent out, etc.</p>

			<p>Later, a community started to form on Facebook to continue support of this XPS 700 series machines; it was here I started to document my reverse engineering, experiments and other findings.  But this Facebook group was not the ideal medium for the mass market to read and apply settings.  For one, a single long Wiki-like post was quickly dropped off the frontpage.  The Facebook group search sucked, etc.  I found myself often repeating the exact same response over and over again, a few months later when someone asked the same question.  I stayed up into the wee hours of the night answering 100s (1000s?) of postings to this Facebook group and repeating myself over and over, just to answer the same question I did a month earlier (because I couldn't link to previous posts) just was too much.</p>

			<p>In 2012, I took matters in my own hands to make sure there was documentation for the community: and thus, 730x.org was born.</p>

			<h3>Outage November 2014 - March 2015</h3>

			<p>Most know that 730x.org went down in late 2014.  This was because of an automated OS patch by the cloud provider hosting the VPS (*cough* heartbleed *cough*) and no alerts were setup to notify the site owner, me, that it was down all that time.  I find that of service to the community unacceptable.  I do not tolerate a single dropped packet or even a dropped connection in my day job during deployments; there is no reason I should lower that requirement for this site.  Much less a 5 month outage.</p>

			<p>I apologize to the community.</p>

			<h3>Stability and the Future of 730x.org</h3>

			<blockquote>
				<p><cite>I have taken steps to ensure the long future and stability of 730x.org.</cite></p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>The site has been converted from the MediaWiki database-driven dynamically-generated site to a static site.  This has a large number of advantages.  Most of all is hosting: this wiki is now hosted by GitHub Pages.  If you are unfamiliar with GitHub pages, I invite you to read up on them as there are many benefits.  Most of all is leveraging GitHub's large infrastructure to keep the site up and running.  And if GitHub pages become unavailable, there are plenty of other static site hosting and CDN providers out there.</p>

			<p>I took steps to remove all cost-factors from hosting, domain, etc.  This was to ensure there would be no kind of payment issues going forward.  I have seen too many sites go away because someone did not keep the billing information up to date.</p>

			<p>What about the domain name: 730x.org?  This is an annual cost, and that fee could quickly get overlooked with expired credit cards, DNS hijacking, etc.  Therefore, I have invested into this to ensure at least a 12 year run starting from 2015: everything from the domain to DNS has been paid in full until 2027.</p>

			<p>In addition, all information on this site will be published and made available in a free electronic PDF book form.  It has been carefully organized into a book table-of-contents format, allowing for it to be printed and published.  Obviously I will get this released to all file-sharing services, allowing it to be found somewhere.</p>

			<p>But wait, there's more!  Have you heard of the Way Back Machine?  This is the Internet's archive of all things internet.  Since this is a static site, you can easily browse the site there if it ever goes offline: http:;/archive.org/730x.org.  Even better, while this V1 version doesn't have the AARP tags, that will be introduced in future releases after I get my content released.  Why AARP?  This ensures screen-readers will cache the content for offline viewing.</p>

			<p>This now leaves two forms of maintenance to keep the wiki up: keeping the DNS entries updated to wherever the site is hosted; and, moving the site to another static provider if GitHub becomes unavailable.  To ensure these, I have enlisted two individuals to help with this that I have known for over 10 years.  We have formed a sort of "730x committee" that has a single purpose: how to keep the site live.  In the event of one of our deaths, the other two have all access.  As long as all three of us do no disappear, the site should remain online now and at least until 2027.</p>

			<p>I believe I have addressed most edge cases.  It is my hope that these steps help secure 730x.org now, and for the future.  -<a href="http://eduncan911.com/">Eric</a></p>
